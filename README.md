# Modelling-of-Impact-of-COVID-19-on-Economical-sectors-at-the-granular-level-in-India
## Worked in the Economic Layer
-The lockdoen is leading to an impact of supply an demand across various sectors

-A total of 90 sub-sectors were taken and a model was created that could give the impact on labour, inward logistics, outward logistics, supply, distribution, working capital availability and demand, against each sector

-These sub-sectors were combined into the most prominent sectors, to get a model that can connect different stages of lockdown to economic impact in terms of productivity and GDP of each sector

-Every region has been mapped to specific sectors, with weights given for each sector active in the region

-This allows us to predict the impact of different stages of lockdown on a particular region(ward-level or village-level)

-In the work that is going on right now (that timeline when Phase II of Economic Impact Model was developed), each region's local context based on hyperlocal tagging across multiple parameters would be considered, and that would help in planning specific incentives on a hyperlocal level, with much more accuracy
